distributedframework
====================

“Distributed Application Framework”, this framework allows application programmers to write multi-threaded applications in C for computing huge mathematical computations like large Matrix multiplications over a distributed set of nodes. This was done solely with the help of the POSIX threads library and the GNU C library for TCP/UDP sockets.
